/* Doubly linked list.

   This implementation of a doubly linked list does not require
   use of dynamically allocated memory.  Instead, each structure
   that is a potential list element must embed a struct list_elem
   member.  All of the list functions operate on these `struct
   list_elem's.  The list_entry macro allows conversion from a
   struct list_elem back to a structure object that contains it.

   For example, suppose there is a needed for a list of `struct
   foo'.  `struct foo' should contain a `struct list_elem'
   member, like so:

      struct foo
        {
          struct list_elem elem;
          int bar;
          ...other members...
        };

   Then a list of `struct foo' can be be declared and initialized
   like so:

      struct list foo_list;

      list_init (&foo_list);

   Iteration is a typical situation where it is necessary to
   convert from a struct list_elem back to its enclosing
   structure.  Here's an example using foo_list:

      struct list_elem *e;

      for (e = list_begin (&foo_list); e != list_end (&foo_list);
           e = list_next (e))
        {
          struct foo *f = list_entry (e, struct foo, elem);
          ...do something with f...
        }

   You can find real examples of list usage throughout the
   source; for example, malloc.c, palloc.c, and thread.c in the
   threads directory all use lists.

   The interface for this list is inspired by the list<> template
   in the C++ STL.  If you're familiar with list<>, you should
   find this easy to use.  However, it should be emphasized that
   these lists do *no* type checking and can't do much other
   correctness checking.  If you screw up, it will bite you.

   Glossary of list terms:

     - "front": The first element in a list.  Undefined in an
       empty list.  Returned by list_front().

     - "back": The last element in a list.  Undefined in an empty
       list.  Returned by list_back().

     - "tail": The element figuratively just after the last
       element of a list.  Well defined even in an empty list.
       Returned by list_end().  Used as the end sentinel for an
       iteration from front to back.

     - "beginning": In a non-empty list, the front.  In an empty
       list, the tail.  Returned by list_begin().  Used as the
       starting point for an iteration from front to back.

     - "head": The element figuratively just before the first
       element of a list.  Well defined even in an empty list.
       Returned by list_rend().  Used as the end sentinel for an
       iteration from back to front.

     - "reverse beginning": In a non-empty list, the back.  In an
       empty list, the head.  Returned by list_rbegin().  Used as
       the starting point for an iteration from back to front.

     - "interior element": An element that is not the head or
       tail, that is, a real list element.  An empty list does
       not have any interior elements.
